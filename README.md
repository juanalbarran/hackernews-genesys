This is to show a hackernews page.  
I'm are gonna use:  

Next.js  
TailwindCSS (Comes with Nextjs)  
RadixUI  
Heroicons  
Dayjs (for human readable dates)

The reason that i'm using NextJS instead of old good react is because it is the current state of the art.  
In the ReactJS documentation the strongly reccommend to use a framwork to work in ReactJS

# hackernews-genesys

This is to show a hackernews clone page.  
I'm gonna use:

Next.js  
TailwindCSS (Comes with Nextjs)  
RadixUI  
Heroicons  
Dayjs (for human readable dates)

The reason that i'm using NextJS instead of old good react is because it is the current state of the art.  
In the ReactJS documentation the strongly reccommend to use a framwork to work in ReactJS

I decided to show all the data in a row (not like the original HN) so everything can be more legible

Also i used a pagination to not overload the page with news that the casual reader is never gonna reach
